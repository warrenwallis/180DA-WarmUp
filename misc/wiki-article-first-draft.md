# A Shallow Deep Dive Into the CAN Protocol

What if I told you that there exists a simple low-cost technology that you can utilize in your projects to land that much coveted summer internship?

Join me on this journey. Trust me, you CAN do it!

Controller Area Network or CAN is a network technology primarily used in embedded systems that provide fast communication amongst microcontrollers. Notably, a network can function as a series of nodes and operate without a host computer [1]. 

*Ok, but what does that mean!?* It means that there isn't a central computer delegating tasks and controlling how messages are sent. Like some cryptocurrencies, a CAN bus is a decentralized network that is able to send messages efficiently across its network.
