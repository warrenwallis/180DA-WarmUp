# A Shallow Deep Dive Into the CAN Protocol

What if I told you that there exists a simple low-cost technology that you can utilize in your projects to land that much coveted summer internship?

Join me on this journey. 

## What is CAN

Controller Area Network or CAN is a network technology primarily used in embedded systems that provide fast communication amongst microcontrollers. Notably, a network can function as a series of nodes and operate without a host computer [1]. 

*Ok, but what does that mean!?* It means that there isn't a central computer delegating tasks and controlling how messages are sent or received. Like some cryptocurrencies, a CAN bus is a decentralized network that is able to send messages efficiently across its network.

Some characteristics of CAN:
- needs only two wires to communicate
- operates at data rates up to 1 Mb/s
- supports a max of 8 Bytes per message frame
- supports message priority
- supports ID lengths of of 11-bits and 29-bits

Some industries of where CAN is used:
- automotive (where it began)
- medical
- manufacturing
- elevators and escalators (where I use it for my job :))

Similar technologies to CAN:
- ethernet
- FPD-link
